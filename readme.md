Groorine is an open source project to develop DTM application. This is started from my project studies.

## Description

I often use "Domino" and "Logic Pro X" to compose music.

I want a music editor which has these good points. And I have wanted to create my original music editor.

## Build

1. clone this project `% git clone https://github.com/Citringo/Groorine.git`
1. Open solution file with Visual Studio 2015
1. Press `F5` to build the project

## Run
Groorine runs on Windows and ".NET Framework 4.5.2". 

You won't be able to run on wine-mono because these may not support WPF (unverified...)

I may port to osx if this project is completed.
